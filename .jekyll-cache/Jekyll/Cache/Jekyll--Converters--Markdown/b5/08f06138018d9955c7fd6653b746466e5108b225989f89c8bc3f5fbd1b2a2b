I"Q<p>Heidis Koch Klub (Heidi’s Cooking Club) - HKK is a digitalization project by Ramon Moorlag.</p>

<p>This project consists of 750+ German recipes for a broad appetite. HKK started in the ‘70 in the German city of Stuttgart. Its key audience was ‘modern woman with a wish to serve the family a wealthy/healthy home-cooked meal.’  Home chefs could prepare most dishes with one card. Only a few cards used another card as a basis (sauces, anyone).</p>

<p>The cards are laminated to go in a shopping bag, used on a kitchen counter, and used during cooking. They are very durable and with the ‘Red Box’ could be stored and used 40 years later. When the project is nearing its goal, I want to compare dietary intake with today’s standards. Is it too fatty, too salty, high cholesterol, or is it a healthy dish by today’s standards?</p>
