I"¸<p>Heidis Koch Klub (Heidiâ€™s Cooking Club) is a project by Ramon Moorlag.
This project consists of 750+ German recipes for a broad appetite. Produced in the â€˜70 in the German city of Stuttgart, itâ€™s now a field of study.</p>

<p>How can these recipes be liberated from paper and published on a website? This is the leading research question. The process of extracting information from PDF scans of the cards will be the main focus. And how to digitalize the 1-meter stack of cards another. The latter will be researched further at a later date. Extraction of the information will be done with the friendly help of <a href="Nanonets.com">Nanonets</a>. Hosting by <a href="www.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> and converting the data files will be done with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>There is a lot of information lost in the eons, millennia, decadesâ€¦ How many cards are there, who wrote them, how many people used them</p>
