Heidis Koch Klub (Heidi's Cooking Club) is a project by Ramon Moorlag.
This project consists of 750+ German recipes for a broad appetite. Produced in the '70 in the German city of Stuttgart, it's now a field of study.

How can these recipes be liberated from paper and published on a website? This is the leading research question. The process of extracting information from PDF scans of the cards will be the main focus. And how to digitalize the 1-meter stack of cards another. The latter will be researched further at a later date. Extraction of the information will be done with the friendly help of [Nanonets](Nanonets.com). Hosting by [GitHub Pages](www.github.com) and converting the data files will be done with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

There is a lot of information lost in the eons, millennia, decades... How many cards are there, who wrote them, how many people used them
